<h2>Description</h2>

This lesson provides an introduction to using GROMACS. GROMACS is a free 
molecular dynamics package primarily used for simulating biochemical molecules 
like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The program is widely used, and a 
large number of publications based on work simulated using GROMACS is 
published every year.

For this lesson, attendees will learn how to prepare, run, and analyse GROMACS 
simulations on the ARCHER2 high-performance computing facility. Attendess will 
learn:
  - How to login to ARCHER2, load modules, and run jobs.
  - How to use GROMACS functions to take generate a fully-solvated, 
    charge-neutral GROMACS structure file from a protein databas file.
  - How to prepare and run a GROMACS simulation of this structure file.
  - How to analyse and visualise GROMACS simulations once they've run.
  - How to determine whether your GROMACS simulations are running optimally. 

This introductory course is intended for anyone interested in learning the 
basics of GROMACS and how to use it.

  Materials will be provided in advance of the lesson and
  large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
  organizers in advance.  If we can help making learning easier for
  you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
  get in touch (using contact details below) and we will
  attempt to provide them.

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`). Finally, you should be 
> comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.
