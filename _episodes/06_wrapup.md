## GROMACS resources

The [GROMACS manual]https://manual.gromacs.org/) contains a lot of information 
about the various functionalities of GROMACS.

In this manual, there is a handy [How-to](https://docs.GROMACS.org/Howto.html) 
section. You can find a number of tutorials in there for understaning and 
running various simulations.

The [GROMACS best practice guide](https://docs.bioexcel.eu/gromacs_bpg/en/master/)
provides a lot of useful tips and tricks for how to set up and run a simple 
system. It also contains a lot of useful information about GROMACS performance 
for systems of varying sizes on different HPC systems -- this can be a useful 
first port of call when trying to determine the amount of compute time that 
your simulations will take.

The [GROMACS tutorials](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/) by Justin Lemkul are 
an excellent place to learn about a number of GROMACS simulation techniques. 
These do a great job of walking users through from their very first simulation 
through to much more advanced work. The associated 
[Living Journal article](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e5068)
is a great companion to go with these tutorials.

Finally, there is the [GROMACS Forum](https://gromacs.bioexcel.eu/). You can 
post questions to this list to have them answered by other members of the 
GROMACS community and by the GROMACS developers. A lot of repeat questions get 
asked there, so before you post your question, have a look through the records 
to check that someone has not already asked it.

## ARCHER2 resources

If you attended the live course, you will retain access to your `ta059` 
account (with a small amount of budget) for a couple of months following the 
course. This is to allow you to make sure that you understood all of the 
course materials and have an opportunity to run any of the exercise 
simulations that you did not have time to complete in the training lesson. 
This is also to let you test out your own simulations on ARCHER2.

If you have any questions about using ARCHER2, the first port of call is the 
[ARCHER2 manual](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/). This manual covers a number of 
aspects of using ARCHER2, from the more simple ""ow to I get a program to run" 
to the more complex "How can I debug my software efficiently on a 
supercomputer".

If you cannot find the answer to your question, please contact the ARCHER2 
support team by email at support@archer2.ac.uk.

## ARCHER2 Training

There is lots of training matieral available through the ARCHER2 service 
covering many different topics and to suit many different levels of 
experience. 

Details of courses, the upcoming schedule and information on how to register 
can be found in the 
[ARCHER2 training pages](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/).

You can also find course material (and sometimes recordings) for previous 
ARCHER2 courses in the 
[ARCHER2 course repository](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/materials/)
