## What is classical molecular dynamics

So far in this course, we have been preparing a system that we would like to 
simulate with GROMACS. We have seen how to take a `.pdb` file from the protein 
database and prepare it using some GROMACS tools. We've also seen how to 
assign a forcefield for our simulation. Now that our system is ready, how do 
we run a simulation of our system using GROMACS? Before we look into this, 
let's consider what is means to run a simulation in GROMACS.

GROMACS is a classical molecular dynamics solver. Classical molecular dynamics 
is a method of simulating the interactions and resultant movement of particles 
through time. Generally, particles will have a function defining their 
interactions with other particles (in our case, this is the forcefield that we 
used when generating the `topol.top` file). From these interactions, we can 
calculate the potential energy of the system and the force acting on each 
particle in the system by using the Newtonian equations of motion. We can use 
the current position of a particle and the force acting on it to derive the 
acceleration and velocity of the particle at this time. Once we have 
calculated the velocity of each particle, we can allow our system to go 
forward in time by a small increment. If the increment is small enough, we can 
assume that the velocity of our particles remains constant over the duration 
of the timestep, and can therefore determine the position of each particle in 
our system once the timestep is complete. From these new positions, we can 
calculate the potential energy, from which we derive the force, acceleration, 
and new velocity of each particle in our system, and with which we can bring 
our system forward in time by a small increment. We can keep repeating this 
for as long as we want.

The repetitive nature of classical molecular dynamics makes it very suitable 
for running on computers. Furthermore, since its first use in 1957, a number of 
methods and techniques have been developed to allow for larger systems to be 
simulated for longer times, as well as methods for making sure that the 
simulation time is spent looking at something significant and of interest. In 
this lesson, we will be discussing some of these methods and techniques and 
how to implement them in GROMACS.

## Running a simulations

For this session, you will need a copy of the `5pep-neutral.gro` and 
`topol.top` files generated in the previous session. You can either copy these 
across or use pregenerated ones. To get the pregenerated files, run:

```bash
  svn checkout https://github.com/EPCCed/20220421_GROMACS_introduction/trunk/exercises
```

Once this is copied, go into the `exercises/running_gromacs` directory. This 
directory contains:

  - `5pep-neutral.gro` -- This is a copy of the solvated and ionised system 
    you prepared in the previous session. It contains information on the 
    particles types, particle positions, bonds, and angles.
  - `topol.top` -- This is a copy of the GROMACS topology file that you 
    prepared in the last session. It contains information about the forcefield 
    used for this system.
  - `minim.mdp` and `npt.mdp` -- These are GROMACS molecular dynamics 
    parameter files. We will be exploring these in details during this session.
  - `sub_ener_minim.slurm`and `sub_npt.slurm` -- These are Slurm submission 
    scripts. They will let you submit GROMACS simulations to the ARCHER2 
    compute nodes.

### The GROMACS molecular dynamics parameters (MDP) file

A [GROMACS molecular dynamics parameter file](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/mdp-options.html) 
lets you define a number of parameters for your simulation. In this file, you 
can set such information as: what specific method you should use to move your 
simulation from timestep to timestep; how large your timestep is; how many 
timesteps your simulation should run for; whether (and how) to fix the 
temperature and/or pressure of your system; what (if any) methods you want to 
include to speed up running your simulation; how you want to handle 
long-ranged interactions; what outputs you want from your simulation and how 
frequently you would like those; and a lot of other things.

## Energy minimisation

Before running a "useful" simulation, we will want to equilibrate our system. 
In the previous session, we added water and ions to our system to random 
positions within our simulation box. This may mean that some of their 
positions or orientations are not physically likely. For example when randomly 
adding water molecules to our simulation box, we may have ended up with a 
number of molecules whose oxygen atoms are close to one another, or with an 
ion in close proximity to a part of our protein with a similar charge. By 
equilibrating our system before running it, we can push our simulation towards 
a more physically realistic state.

There are many ways of equilibrating a system. You can:
  - Run an equilibration simulation that starts at a temperature of 0 K and 
    increases slowly to the temperature that you're wanting to simulate;
  - Run an equilibration simulation with a very small timestep to allow your 
    system to "relax" into a more realistic configuration
  - Reduce the potential energy of a system by using an energy-minimisation 
    techniques;
  - etc.

GROMACS handily provides a number of energy minimisation protocols so we shall 
use one of these. The protocol we will use if the "steepest descent" 
algorithm. This algorithm will effectively force our system into a potential 
energy minimum thereby ensuring that our system is "relaxed". If you want to 
find out more about the way this works, the 
[gradient descent Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) 
is a great starting place.


```bash
  ; minim.mdp - taken from http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/
  ; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
  integrator      = steep     ; steepest descent algorithm
  emtol           = 1000.0    ; Stop minimization when max. force < 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm
  emstep          = 0.01      ; Minimization step size
  nsteps          = 50000     ; Maximum number of (minimization) steps to perform

  ; Logs and outputs
  nstlog          = 500       ; number of steps between each log output
  nstenergy       = 500       ; number of steps between each energy file output
  nstxout         = 500       ; number of steps between each output to the coordinate file
  
  ; Parameters describing how to find the neighbors of each atom and how to calculate the interactions
  nstlist         = 1         ; Frequency to update the neighbor list and long range forces
  cutoff-scheme   = Verlet    ; Buffered neighbor searching
  ns_type         = grid      ; Method to determine neighbor list (simple, grid)
  coulombtype     = PME       ; Treatment of long range electrostatic interactions
  rcoulomb        = 1.0       ; Short-range electrostatic cut-off
  rvdw            = 1.0       ; Short-range Van der Waals cut-off
  pbc             = xyz       ; Periodic Boundary Conditions in all 3 dimensions
```

Before we can run this, we will use the GROMACS pre-processing tool `grompp` 
to group all of the information for our simulation into a simulation input 
file (what GROMACS calls a "portable binary file" or `.tpr` file). We can do 
this from the ARCHER2 login node by running:

```bash
  gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c 5pep-neutral.gro -p topol.top -o ener_minim.tpr
```

This will generate our simulation run file `ener_minim.tpr`. We can now use 
this to run a GROMACS simulation on ARCHER2. We could run this on the ARCHER2 
login node **but** that would take much too long and use up valuable shared 
resources. Instead, we will submit a job to the Slurm scheduler and have this 
run on the compute nodes. There, we will be able to use the full 128 cores on 
the nodes and ensure that our job will finish more quickly.

To submit your job on the login nodes, run:

```bash
  sbatch sub_ener_minim.slurm
```

If we take a look at the Slurm submission script, we will notice that there 
are a number of commands defining what resources we want to reserve with Slurm 
(all of the commands that start with `#SBATCH`), a command to load the GROMACS 
module that we've been using, a command to define the number of OpenMP threads 
we want (we will talk more about this in the final session of today when we 
discuss performance), and a GROMACS command line (it is commented with a `#` 
below to ensure that no-one accidentally copies it to run on the ARCHER2 login 
nodes):

```bash
  # gmx mdrun -ntomp ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} -v -s ener_minim.tpr
```

The [`mdrun`](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-mdrun.html)
command indicates that this is a molecular dynamics run -- though the aim of 
this is to equilibrate the system, this still constitutes a GROMACS molecular 
dynamics simulation. the `-v` flag specifies that we would like a verbose 
output to the GROMACS log file -- this can be particularly useful for 
debugging your simulation when anything goes wrong. The `-s` flag lets us 
define our GROMACS `.tpr` file. Finally, the `-ntomp` flag defines the number 
of OpenMP threads we want per MPI process (in this case one).

You can check that your job is in the queue by running:

```bash
  squeue --me
```

Once your job has completed, you will notice that a number of outputs have 
been generated:

  - `md.log` -- A text file that contains all of the thermodynamic information 
     output during the run (e.g. energy breakdowns, instantaneous pressure 
     and temperature, system density, etc.).
  - `ener.edr` -- A binary file that contains all of the thermodynamic 
    information output during the run (e.g. energy breakdowns, instantaneous 
     pressure and temperature, system density, etc.).
  - `traj.trr` -- A binary that contains details of the simulation trajectory.
  - `confout.gro` -- A text file containing the particle coordinates and 
    velocities for the final step of the simulation.
  - `slurm-#######.out` -- The Slurm output and error file for this job.
 
From these files, we can extract useful information to check that our jobs 
have completed successfully. For instance, we can use the GROMACS `energy` 
command to extract the potential energy of our system at every logged timestep 
and check that the energy is now sensible. We can do this by running:

```bash
  gmx energy -f ener.edr -o potential.xvg
```

Select option `10` to plot the total potential energy of the system and option 
`0` to exit the program. This will have generated a new file called 
`potential.xvg` -- this is an XMGrace file that has the timestep in the first 
column and the total potential energy of the system in the second column. We 
can plot it to check that the energy has decreased and is now at or near a 
minimum.

## NPT simulations

Now that we have equilibrated our system, we can move on to simulating it 
in more physical conditions. We will run a simulation in the 
isobaric-isothermic ensemble (fixed pressure and temperature).

For this step, we will need the `topol.top` and `confout.gro` files generated 
by out equilibration step. Like with energy minimisation, we will combine 
these along with a GROMACS molecular dynamics parameter file to create our 
portable binary file.

In a new directory, copy the `topol.top`, `confout.gro`, `npt.mdp` and 
`sub_npt.slurm` files. Then run:

```bash
  gmx grompp -f npt.mdp -c confout.gro -r confout.gro -p topol.top -o npt.tpr
```

The file `npt.mdp` has the following commands:

```bash
  ; npt.mdp -- taken from: https://docs.bioexcel.eu/gromacs_bpg/
  ; Intergrator, timestep, and total run time
  integrator               = md                ; Leap-frog MD algorithm
  dt                       = 0.002             ; Sets timestep at 2 ns
  nsteps                   = 500000            ; Sim will run 500,000 timesteps
  
  ; Logs and outputs
  nstlog                   = 500               ; Output to md.log every 500 dt
  nstenergy                = 500               ; Output to ener.edr every 500 dt
  nstxout                  = 500               ; Output to trajj.trr every 500 dt
  
  ; Bond constraints
  constraints              = h-bonds           ; Make H bonds in protein be rigid
  constraint-algorithm     = lincs             ; Define algorithm to make bonds rigid
  
  ; Van der Waals interactions
  vdwtype                  = Cut-off           ; Define type of short-ranged interaction
  rvdw                     = 1.0               ; Define short-ranged cutoff as 1 nm
  cutoff-scheme            = Verlet            ; Generate pair lists to speed up simulation
  DispCorr                 = EnerPres          ; Apply corrections to mitigate using cutoff
  pbc                      = xyz               ; PBC in all 3 dimensions
  
  ; Coulombic interactions
  coulombtype              = PME               ; Define type of long-ranged interactions
  rcoulomb                 = 1.0               ; Define long-ranged cutoff as 1nm
  
  ; Thermostat
  tcoupl                   = V-rescale         ; Define type of thermostat
  tc-grps                  = Protein  SOL NA   ; Define groups to be affected by thermostat
  ref-t                    = 300      300 300  ; Define temperature for each group in Kelvins
  tau-t                    = 0.1      0.1 0.1  ; Define temperature coupling time
  
  ; Barostat
  pcoupl                   = Parrinello-Rahman ; Define type of barostat
  ref-p                    = 1.0               ; Define system pressure in bars
  tau-p                    = 2.0               ; Define pressure coupling time
  compressibility          = 4.5e-5            ; Define compressibility of system in bar^-1

```

You will notice that we have not defined some of the parameters that we had 
defined in `ener_minim.mdp`. This is because, for this simulation, we are 
happy to use the GROMACS default values for these parameters. GROMACS will set 
a number of simulations parameters to a default value if they are left 
unspecified -- if you are running something that GROMACS expects you to run 
(e.g. if you are running a "standard" biochemical system) you should be fine. 
If, however, you are running something different, your system may well produce 
unexpected and non-physical results unless you are careful with what defaults 
you allow.

As before, we will be running this on the compute nodes by using:

```bash
  sbatch sub_npt.slurm
```

This simulation will take around 7 minutes to complete and, once it is 
complete, you will have a similar set of files generated as were produced in 
the energy minimisation step but with one addition. There is now also a 
GROMACS checkpoint (`.cpt`) file that keeps track of information related to 
the barostat and thermostat. With this file, you can restart simulations while 
ensuring that your temperature and pressure coupling are not wrong.
