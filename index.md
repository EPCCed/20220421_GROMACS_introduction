<h2>Description</h2>

This lesson provides an introduction to using ARCHER2 for users who:
  - have already used other HPC systems; and
  - want to compile (and possibly) develop HPC software on ARCHER2.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:
  - What hardware is available on ARCHER2?
    + What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
    + How does this impact me as a user?
  - How can I access ARCHER2 interactively and transfer data?
  - What does the ARCHER2 application development environment look like and how do I use it?
  - How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the ARCHER2 scheduler?
  - How can I be a good ARCHER2 citizen?
  - How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
  - What are the next steps for me using ARCHER2 and how can I get more help?

> ## Prerequisites
> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`). Finally, you should be 
> comfortable with compiling parallel HPC source code that uses MPI and OpenMP.
